## @teseract/server-api tesselator

Tesselator is a regolith-based addon compiler focused on scripting development with TypeScript. With resemblance to fabric-loom, this implements the concept of project folders, allowing you to import your add-on files from outside of your com.mojang folder, which also offers an extra protection layer from you loosing your progress if the com.mojang folder, somehow, dissapears or is deleted.
